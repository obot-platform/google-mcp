# Hosted MCP usage telemetry

The usage endpoint reports cumulative tool attempts, errors, and `errorCategories` for each process and UTC day. Every counted error belongs to one category:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `authentication` | HTTP 401 or recognized credential failures. |
| `permission` | HTTP 403 or explicit access/scope denial. |
| `rate_limit` | HTTP 429 or provider throttling codes, including throttling returned as 403. |
| `invalid_request` | Other HTTP 4xx responses, invalid MCP requests/arguments, or input validation failures. |
| `not_found` | HTTP 404 or explicit missing-resource codes. |
| `timeout` | HTTP 408/504 or deadline/timeout failures. |
| `upstream` | Other HTTP 5xx responses or network connection failures. |
| `other` | Unrecognized failures. |

Specific categories take precedence over generic HTTP groups. Classification inspects structured status/provider codes and wrapped causes first, then a bounded allowlist of error-text formats. Inspection failures fall back to `other`. Error messages, tool inputs, and results are never included in telemetry.

Category counts sum to `errors`; successful tools emit `{}`. Each process restart gets a new instance ID and daily rollover clears all counters. Existing attempt, error, cancellation, and user accounting semantics are preserved.

This is an additive `schemaVersion: "v1"` field. Roll out the Managed Stats server/schema, then its collector, then these producer images. Older reports appear under Other / unknown; historical categories cannot be reconstructed.

The Python and Go classifiers use matching rules and copies of `error-cases.json`. Keep these rules and fixtures in sync across the Google and Microsoft repositories.

Run the tests using the Drive service's locked dependencies:

```sh
cd drive
PYTHONPATH=../shared uv run --frozen --no-dev python -m unittest discover -s ../shared/tests
```
